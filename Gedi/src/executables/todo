Parameter for global parameter estimation (genome, target list; by default: first genome, without mt-!)
output table

1. Prediction: Very short half-lives should have > shape
2. Prediction: For mt- genes, shape should be different
3. Prediction: For viral genes in +mcmv: >shape
4. Prediction: Same for induced genes (from 0 to something, e.g. ISGs)
