     * Computes suffix array for sequence of symbols (integers). The processed sequence is
     * a subsequence of <code>input</code> determined by <code>start</code> and
     * <code>length</code> parameters.
     * <p>
     * Concrete implementations may have additional requirements and constraints
     * concerning the input. For example, it is quite common that extra cells are required
     * after <code>start + length</code> to store special marker symbols. Also, some
     * algorithms may require non-negative symbols in the input. For such constrained
     * algorithms, use various decorators and adapters available in this package.
     * 
     * @param input A sequence of input symbols, int-coded.
     * @param start The starting index (inclusive) in <code>input</code>.
     * @param length Number of symbols to process.
     * @return An array of indices such that the suffix of <code>input</code> at index
     *         <code>result[i]</code> is lexicographically larger or equal to any other
     *         suffix that precede it. Note that the output array may be larger than
     *         <code>input.length</code>, in which case only the first
     *         <code>input.length</code> elements are of relevance.
     *         <p>
     *         The returned array contains suffix indexes starting from 0 (so
     *         <code>start</code> needs to be added manually to access a given suffix in
     *         <code>input</code>).
